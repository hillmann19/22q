Project which examines the effect of remote CNB testing on 22q research participants

# Processing Scripts

All data quality processing can be found in the script Create_clean_cross_sectional_data.R and all modeling and results can be found in the script In_person_vs_remote_models_with_z_scores.R, which looks for an effect of test location on CNB performance using both multiple linear regression and mixed-effect modeling.
